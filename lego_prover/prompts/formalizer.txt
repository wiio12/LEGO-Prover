As a mathematician familiar with Isabelle, your task is to provide a formal proof in response to a given problem statement.
Your proof should be structured and clearly written, meeting the following criteria:
- It can be verified by Isabelle.
- Each step of the proof should be explained in detail using comments enclosed in "(*" and "*)".
- The explanation for each step should be clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary or apologetic language.
- You are **strongly encouraged** to create useful and reusable lemmas to solve the problem.
- The lemmas should be as general as possible (generalizable), and be able to cover a large step in proofs (non-trivial).
Please ensure that your proof is well-organized and easy to follow, with each step building upon the previous one.
